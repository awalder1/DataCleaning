The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy
data set that can be used for later analysis. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following.
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final dataset is called HumanActivityMeans
